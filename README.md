Alex's Tic-Tac-Toe Game
https://squirtlesquad1988.github.io/tic-tac-toe/

Technologies Used:
AJAX, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SCSS, Google fonts

The planning phase of this project consisted of following
the suggested schedule as suggested by instructor Jeff Horn. The first
item on the list was to model the engine and get it running in node.js. To
accomplish this I mapped out what I believed would be the step by step process
that occurs as a game of Tic-Tac-Toe takes place. Doing this two or three
times was very helpful as I was able to figure out, in detail, how a game
of Tic-Tac-Toe works and how to translate that into basic JavaScript.
Once the basic game engine was running my next step was to translate that into
the browser. This was much more difficult than the initial engine modeling
but I was able to accomplish it by going over some jQuery and I was able to get
the app running in the browser.
The next step in the process was to transfer what was occuring in the browser to
the server using AJAX. This was much more difficult than the previous two stages
of the project but - again - after taking a module on AJAX on CodeSchool.com and
reading the game-project-api documentation I was able to figure it out.

If I were to start the project over again I would do many things differently.
The first and most important thing I would do over again would be to map how I
am going to organize my code in my files. On the tail-end of the project I
had to do a major overhaul of my code organization in order to get some functions
to work properly. This could have been avoided if I had organized my code
properly from the very beginning. Second, I would look on the repo on solution
branches to make sure the code I copied in class was accurate what was intended
in class. Toward the end of my project there were a few errors that were typos
from mis-copied code from class. In addition, if I were to know what I know about AJAX when I
started the project it would be a lot easier as I would be more efficient
about event delegation. Overall I am happy with my progress that I made
on the project. I feel like having to create a SPA truely made me internalize the
majority of the material covered in Unit One.

In future generations I want to style the SPA a little more using Bootstrap and
CSS, possibly add some animations using jQuery. I would also want give it a theme.

I only finished the project Sunday night so I wasn't really able to fully
consider styling and layout after the initial requirements were complete. As a
result, only one wireframe was created:

User Stories:
As a user I want to be able to create account so I can track my stats.
As a user I want to be able to start a new game after I finish one.
As a user I want to be able to play cooperatively with a friend.
As a user I want to be able to change my password.
As a user I want to be abe to see the winner of a game.
